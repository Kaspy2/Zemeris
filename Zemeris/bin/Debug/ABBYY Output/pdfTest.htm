<p><span class="font2">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its&nbsp;requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and&nbsp;the general principles defined herein may be applied to other&nbsp;embodiments and applications without departing from the&nbsp;spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present&nbsp;invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments&nbsp;shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with&nbsp;the principles and features disclosed herein. The present&nbsp;invention may be operated as a computer program installed&nbsp;upon a download computer, via a website or other system. It&nbsp;can be also appreciated that even though the description&nbsp;below is about downloading, searching and managing electronic patent files, the present invention may also be utilized&nbsp;for downloading, searching and managing electronic trademark files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data structures and code described in this detailed description are typically stored on a computer readable storage medium, which may be any device or medium that can&nbsp;store code and/or data for use by a computer system. This&nbsp;includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage&nbsp;devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact&nbsp;discs), DVDs (digital video discs), and computer instruction&nbsp;signals embodied in a transmission medium (with or without&nbsp;a carrier wave upon which the signals are modulated). For&nbsp;example, the transmission medium may include a communications network, such as the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemplary Global Computer Network</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The global computer network (e.g. Internet) is an exemplary communications network for the present invention. The Internet is basically comprised of a “global computer network.” A plurality of computer systems around the world are&nbsp;in communication with one another via this global computer&nbsp;network and are able to transmit various types of data&nbsp;between one another. The communications between the computer systems may be accomplished via various methods such&nbsp;as but not limited to wireless, Ethernet, cable, direct connection, telephone lines, and satellite. One or more web servers&nbsp;typically provide the data to the computer systems connected&nbsp;via the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The present invention may also be utilized upon global computer networks, local area networks (LAN), wide area&nbsp;networks (WAN), campus area networks (CAN), metropolitan-area networks (MAN), and home area networks (HAN).&nbsp;Various protocols may be utilized by the electronic devices&nbsp;for communications such as but not limited to HTTP, SMTP,&nbsp;FTP and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). The present&nbsp;invention may be implemented upon various wireless networks such as but not limited to CDPD, CDMA, GSM, PDC,&nbsp;PHS, TDMA, FLEX, REFLEX, IDEN, TETRA, DECT,&nbsp;DATATAC, and MOBITEX . The present invention may also&nbsp;be utilized with online services and internet service providers&nbsp;such as AMERICA ONLINE (AOL), COMPUSERVE,&nbsp;WEBTV, and MSN INTERNET SERVICES. The present&nbsp;invention preferably utilizes the Internet for transmitting&nbsp;data, however it can be appreciated that as future technologies&nbsp;are created that various aspects of the invention may be practiced with these improved technologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The present invention is preferably embodied within a software application installed upon the download computer.&nbsp;However, the present invention may be embodied in various&nbsp;other manners such as but not limited to a central server&nbsp;computer or a web server that merely provide the results of the&nbsp;analyzed patent data. The present invention may also be&nbsp;implemented at the government patent office when a patent&nbsp;document is scanned into their system or by a patent applicant&nbsp;when filing electronic patent applications to ensure that all of&nbsp;the figures regardless of their original orientation are shown&nbsp;with all the text readable in a horizontal state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C. Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Patent documents may be comprised of various documents including but not limited to non-filed patent applications,&nbsp;filed patent applications, published patent applications,&nbsp;granted patents, patent certificates and patent file wrappers.&nbsp;Downloading patent files (image and/or text) from patent&nbsp;websites (e.g. www.uspto.gov,ep.espacenet.com/) via a global computer network is well known in the art. The patent files&nbsp;may be comprised of issued patents, published applications or&nbsp;related patent data. Various software programs (e.g. PATEN-THUNTER sold by PatentWizard, LLC) and websites currently allow for the downloading of patent files from patent&nbsp;websites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The patent documents are in a computer readable file format and may be available directly from the computer or via downloading through the global computer network. For&nbsp;example, a user may analyze the text of a MICROSOFT&nbsp;WORD document containing a patent application or an&nbsp;HTML file downloaded from the global computer network.&nbsp;Various other file formats may be analyzed with the present&nbsp;invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C. Figure Correction of Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A patent document is typically stored on a web server or the user’s computer in an image file format such as but not limited&nbsp;to PDF (Portable Document Format) or TIFF (Tagged Image&nbsp;File Format). The patent document may then be viewed electronically using a conventional image viewer (e.g. ADOBE&nbsp;ACROBAT). Since many patent documents include some or&nbsp;all figures drawn in a “landscape” position the images are&nbsp;displayed in a manner that is rotated counter-clockwise 90&nbsp;degrees making it difficult to review the figure when electronically shown. In addition, when the patent document is&nbsp;printed these same figures are printed in landscape position&nbsp;making it further difficult to review the patent figures of the&nbsp;patent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example, pages 2 and 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 are in a landscape orientation while the other pages are in a&nbsp;regular “portrait” orientation. Pages 1, 3-5, 7-11 of U.S. Pat.&nbsp;No. 6,545,666 are in the portrait orientation and are easy to&nbsp;view both in an electronic format in an image viewer and in a&nbsp;printed copy. The text, element numbers, figures and the&nbsp;figure indicia for these patents are all orientated in a horizontal manner which is traditionally how text and images are&nbsp;viewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, pages 2 and 6 which comprise FIGS. 1 and 8 respectively of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 are originally in a&nbsp;“landscape” orientation, but they were scanned by the U.S.&nbsp;Patent &amp; Trademark Office in the “portrait” orientation making it increasingly difficult to view these two figures both&nbsp;electronically and in print. The electronic file image is set to&nbsp;the “portrait” position for all of the pages of U.S. Pat. No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6,545,666 despite FIGS. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font2">thereof actually being in an&nbsp;original landscape position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying “Figure Pages”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1, </span><span class="font2">the present invention first acquires the patent image file which may be in a PDF, TIFF or other file&nbsp;format. The original patent image file may have to be converted to a different file format to facilitate an efficient OCR&nbsp;process of the patent image file (the patent image file may&nbsp;later be converted back to the original file format or a different&nbsp;file format).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once the patent image file is acquired, the pages of the patent document containing the figure(s) are first identified&nbsp;using a conventional OCR (optical character recognition)&nbsp;process. Various file formats may be used (e.g. TIFF, PDF) for&nbsp;the OCR process, however it is preferable that the TIFF file&nbsp;format be utilized which requires the conversion of other file&nbsp;formats to TIFF. The first page of the patent document can&nbsp;typically be skipped since the cover page of United States&nbsp;patents is always in a portrait position with all of the text and&nbsp;the exemplary figure in an easy to read horizontal aligned&nbsp;format.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the OCR process, the header of the pages containing one or more figures typically have a “figure identifier” such as “Sheet _ of or other indicator information along&nbsp;with other identifying information. The text portions of a&nbsp;patent document typically do not have this header identification information at the top of their pages, so this information&nbsp;is used to identify the drawing sheets of a patent document.&nbsp;Other methods may be used to identify the drawing sheets&nbsp;such as (1) identifying the first set of pages with little text in&nbsp;them, (2) identifying the first set of pages with a lot of white&nbsp;space, (3) identifying the first set of pages with “FIG. on&nbsp;them, (4) identifying the first page containing the text BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (or other text used on the&nbsp;first textual page of the patent document) thereby the pages&nbsp;between the cover page and the identified page are the drawing sheets, (5) identifying where a substantial quantity of text&nbsp;is used indicating the start of the text pages, (6) identifying&nbsp;where column numbers and/or line numbers are used indicating the start of the text pages, or (7) any combination of the&nbsp;above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 (“the ’666 patent”), pages 2 through 6 each include “Sheet _ of 5” in their&nbsp;header which through an OCR process are identified as being&nbsp;“Figure Pages”. Page 2 of the ’666 patent has “Sheet 1 of 5”,&nbsp;page 2 of the ’666 patent has “Sheet 2 of 5” and so forth. The&nbsp;present invention identifies these pages as the Figure Pages&nbsp;since none of the other pages have this type of header information in them. In addition, the header of each of the Figure&nbsp;Pages of the ’666 patent also include “U.S. Patent” text on the&nbsp;left side, followed by “Apr. 8, 2003” and with “U.S. Pat. No.&nbsp;6,545,666” which may be utilized to identify the figure sheets&nbsp;since this information is not contained within the headers of&nbsp;the text pages of the patent document.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For older United States patents, the “Sheet _ of _’’ format is not utilized for drawing sheets. For example for earlier patents (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3,500,000) the cover page is actually&nbsp;one of the Figure Pages and a header format of Sheets-Sheet is utilized. For United States patents granted in 1972&nbsp;and thereafter the cover page is typically only the cover page&nbsp;followed by the Figure Pages which have a header format of&nbsp;“Sheet _ of The Figure Pages are identified by this header&nbsp;information and the program preferably only analyzes rotating the position of the Figure Pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It should also be noted that Figure Pages are always consecutive so the present invention is able to determine a missed Figure Page by identifying the first Figure Page and the last&nbsp;Figure Page. For example, if page 2 of the patent document is&nbsp;identified as the first Figure Page, page 2 is not identified as a&nbsp;Figure Page but page 3 is identified as a Figure Page, the&nbsp;present invention simply accepts page 2 as a Figure Page&nbsp;since the misidentification may have resulted from an OCR&nbsp;issue or patent printing issue by the governmental office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining what Figure(s) Originally in “Landscape”&nbsp;and Correcting the Landscape Figure Pages</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once the drawing sheets are identified, the present invention then OCR’s these pages to identify the orientation of the figure labels and/or the element numbers (this process may be&nbsp;done simultaneously with the identification of the Figure&nbsp;Pages, before the same or thereafter). The present invention&nbsp;first does the OCR process on the Figure Pages in their normal&nbsp;portrait orientation as they were originally scanned by the&nbsp;government office. If the OCR process is able to identify a&nbsp;significant number of element numbers (e.g. greater than 5),&nbsp;a significant number of letters (e.g. greater than 5) and/or one&nbsp;or more figure labels (e.g. “FIG. _”) then the present invention&nbsp;determines that the particular Figure Page is in the proper&nbsp;orientation as shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font2">of the drawings. However, if a&nbsp;threshold level is not identified in the OCR process (or it could&nbsp;automatically proceed with this step regardless of what is&nbsp;found in the initial OCR process), the present invention then&nbsp;rotates the Figure Page clockwise 90 degrees and performs a&nbsp;secondary OCR process similar to the first process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the number of element numbers, letters and/or figure labels (“FIG. _”) in the secondary OCR process with the&nbsp;Figure Page in the rotated page is greater than in the initial&nbsp;OCR process, the present invention determines that the Figure Page is in the wrong orientation and sets the orientation&nbsp;setting for the particular Figure Page to “landscape” thereby&nbsp;modifying the orientation of the Figure Page clockwise by 90&nbsp;degrees as shown in FIGS. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font2">through </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font2">of the drawings (in the&nbsp;’666 patent example). This process continues for each of the&nbsp;Figure Pages until all of the Figure Pages are properly orientated so they are easily viewed by a user as shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;the drawings. The patent document is thereby viewed in a&nbsp;conventional viewer (e.g. ADOBE ACROBAT) without the&nbsp;user having to manually rotate the orientation of the patent&nbsp;image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition or alternatively, a preprocessing module may be utilized to automatically determine the page orientation for&nbsp;each page of the patent image (i.e. is it in a portrait or landscape position) for each of the pages of the patent document&nbsp;or the Figure Pages. It is well known to utilize preprocessing&nbsp;modules in OCR scanning to determine the page orientation&nbsp;prior to performing an OCR on a document. Any page of the&nbsp;patent document determined to be in a landscape orientation&nbsp;is then be rotated clockwise 90 degrees so that it may be easily&nbsp;reviewed by an individual electronically. A preprocessing&nbsp;module used within the present invention would simplify the&nbsp;overall process of determining the Figure Pages that are orientated in an undesirable orientation without having to rely&nbsp;upon identifying text within the figures themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reorganizing Landscape Figure Pages</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even though the orientation setting is modified to “landscape” for the Landscape Figure Pages (e.g. pages 2 and 6 of the ’666 patent), the pages will print as they originally were&nbsp;scanned by the government office resulting in a printed version of the patent document that is difficult to review (e.g.&nbsp;pages 2 and 6 of the ’ 666 patent would still be printed with the&nbsp;image rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees). It is preferable&nbsp;that the printed pages of the patent document all be easily&nbsp;viewed and in an orientation that allows the reviewer to easily&nbsp;read the element numbers, figure labels and the images themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The present invention further preferably modifies the actual image of Landscape Figure Pages so that these pages&nbsp;remain in a “portrait” orientation but the actual image on the&nbsp;page is rotated clockwise 90 degrees thereby resulting in a&nbsp;printed patent document that is easily viewed similar to the&nbsp;electronic version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After identifying the Figure Pages that are originally formatted in the landscape position (e.g. pages 2 and 6 of the ’666 patent), the present invention takes these pages and&nbsp;identifies the image portion on the page which may be done&nbsp;by assuming the margins of the page or by analyzing the&nbsp;locations where no image pixels are located (i.e. white space&nbsp;is identified thereby indicating no image present). The present&nbsp;invention then copies/cuts this selected image area (see FIG.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6) </span><span class="font2">and then pastes the image into a new Figure Page rotated 90&nbsp;degrees clockwise as shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font2">of the drawings. It is&nbsp;preferable that the header information remain on the new&nbsp;Figure Page as shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font2">of the drawings. The new&nbsp;Figure Page (FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8) </span><span class="font2">is then added to the patent document&nbsp;image file with the original corresponding Figure Page&nbsp;removed (i.e. this modified figure replaces the figure). It is&nbsp;preferable to have a notification on the modified Figure Page&nbsp;to indicate that this is not an original page of the patent&nbsp;document such as “*** Figure Page Modified ***” which&nbsp;may be placed at the header or other locations on the page.</span></p>
