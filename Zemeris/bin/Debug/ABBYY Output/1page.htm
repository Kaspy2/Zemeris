<p><span class="font2">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its&nbsp;requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and&nbsp;the general principles defined herein may be applied to other&nbsp;embodiments and applications without departing from the&nbsp;spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present&nbsp;invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments&nbsp;shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with&nbsp;the principles and features disclosed herein. The present&nbsp;invention may be operated as a computer program installed&nbsp;upon a download computer, via a website or other system. It&nbsp;can be also appreciated that even though the description&nbsp;below is about downloading, searching and managing electronic patent files, the present invention may also be utilized&nbsp;for downloading, searching and managing electronic trademark files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hie data structures and code described in this detailed description are typically stored on a computer readable storage medium, which may be any device or medium that can&nbsp;store code and/or data for use by a computer system. This&nbsp;includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage&nbsp;devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact&nbsp;discs), DVDs (digital video discs), and computer instruction&nbsp;signals embodied in a transmission medium (with or without&nbsp;a carrier wave upon which the signals are modulated). For&nbsp;example, the transmission medium may include a communications network, such as the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemplary Global Computer Network</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The global computer network (e.g. Internet) is an exemplary communications network for the present invention, rhe Internet is basically comprised of a “global computer network.” A plurality of computer systems around the world are&nbsp;in communication with one another via this global computer&nbsp;network and are able to transmit various types of data&nbsp;between one another. The communications between the computer systems may be accomplished via various methods such&nbsp;as but not limited to wireless, Ethernet, cable, direct connection, telephone lines, and satellite. One or more web servers&nbsp;typically provide the data to the computer systems connected&nbsp;via the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The present invention may also be utilized upon global computer networks, local area networks (LAN), wide area&nbsp;networks (WAN), campus area networks (CAN), metropolitan-area networks (MAN), and home area networks (HAN).&nbsp;Various protocols may be utilized by the electronic devices&nbsp;for communications such as but not limited to HTTP, SMTP,&nbsp;FTP and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). The present&nbsp;invention may be implemented upon various wireless networks such as but not limited to CDPD, CDMA, GSM, PDC,&nbsp;PHS, TDMA, FLEX, REFLEX, IDEN, TETRA, DECT,&nbsp;DATATAC, and MOBITEX . The present invention may also&nbsp;be utilized with online services and internet service providers&nbsp;such as AMERICA ONLINE (AOL), COMPUSERVE,&nbsp;WEBTV, and MSN INTERNET SERVICES. The present&nbsp;invention preferably utilizes the Internet for transmitting&nbsp;data, however it can be appreciated that as future technologies&nbsp;are created that various aspects of the invention may be practiced with these improved technologies.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">computer or a web server that merely provide the results of the analyzed patent data. The present invention may also be&nbsp;implemented at the government patent office when a patent&nbsp;document is scanned into their system or by a patent applicant&nbsp;when filing electronic patent applications to ensure that all of&nbsp;the figures regardless of their original orientation are shown&nbsp;with all the text readable in a horizontal state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C. Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Patent documents may be comprised of various documents including but not limited to non-filed patent applications,&nbsp;filed patent applications, published patent applications,&nbsp;granted patents, patent certificates and patent file wrappers.&nbsp;Downloading patent files (image and/or text) from patent&nbsp;websites (e.g. www.uspto.gov,ep.espacenet.com/) via a global computer network is well known in the art. The patent files&nbsp;maybe comprised of issued patents, published applications or&nbsp;related patent data. Various software programs (e.g. PATEN-THUNTER sold by PatentWizard, LLC) and websites currently allow for the downloading of patent files from patent&nbsp;websites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The patent documents are in a computer readable file format and may be available directly from the computer or via downloading through the global computer network. For&nbsp;example, a user may analyze the text of a MICROSOFT&nbsp;WORD document containing a patent application or an&nbsp;HTML file downloaded from the global computer network.&nbsp;Various other file formats may be analyzed with the present&nbsp;invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C. Figure Correction of Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A patent document is typically stored on a web server or the user’s computer in an image file format such as but not limited&nbsp;to PDF (Portable Document Format) or TIFF (Tagged Image&nbsp;File Format), rhe patent document may then be viewed electronically using a conventional image viewer (e.g. ADOBE&nbsp;ACROBAT). Since many patent documents include some or&nbsp;all figures drawn in a “landscape” position the images are&nbsp;displayed in a manner that is rotated counter-clockwise 90&nbsp;degrees making it difficult to review the figure when electronically shown. In addition, when the patent document is&nbsp;printed these same figures are printed in landscape position&nbsp;making it further difficult to review the patent figures of the&nbsp;patent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example, pages 2 and 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 are in a landscape orientation while the other pages are in a&nbsp;regular “portrait” orientation. Pages 1,3-5,7-11 of U.S. Pat.&nbsp;No. 6,545,666 are in the portrait orientation and are easy to&nbsp;view both in an electronic format in an image viewer and in a&nbsp;printed copy. The text, element numbers, figures and the&nbsp;figure indicia for these patents are all orientated in a horizontal manner which is traditionally how text and images are&nbsp;viewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, pages 2 and 6 which comprise FIGS. 1 and 8 respectively of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 are originally in a&nbsp;“landscape” orientation, but they were scanned by the U.S.&nbsp;Patent &amp; Trademark Office in the “portrait” orientation making it increasingly difficult to view these two figures both&nbsp;electronically and in print. The electronic file image is set to&nbsp;the “portrait” position for all of the pages of U.S. Pat. No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6,545,666 despite FIGS. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font2">thereof actually being in an&nbsp;original landscape position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying “Figure Pages”</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">The present invention is preferably embodied within a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">software application installed upon the download computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, the present invention may be embodied in various</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">other manners such as but not limited to a central server</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As shown in FIG. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1, </span><span class="font2">the present invention first acquires the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">patent image file which may be in a PDF, TIFF or other file</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">format. The original patent image file may have to be con</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">verted to a different file fonnat to facilitate an efficient OCR</span></p>
