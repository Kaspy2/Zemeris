FIG. 3 is an overall view of all the pages for U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 after page 2 and page 6 have been modified to the "landscape" orientation, and running is cooler than History. As best shown in FIGS. 5 through 7 of the drawings, the elongate body 20 is preferably cylindrical in shape. It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the elongate body 20 may have various cross sectional shapes such as circular, square, oval, rectangular and other well-known shapes. 

A further object is to provide a method for correcting orientation of patent figures that corrects both electronic images of patents (e.g. PDF, TIFF) and/or printed images of patents to ensure that all pages are in a portrait orientation.

The global computer network (e.g. Internet) is an exemplary communications network for the present invention. The Internet is basically comprised of a "global computer network."

However, pages 2 and 6 which comprise FIGS. 1 and 8 respectively of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 are originally in a "landscape" orientation, but they were scanned by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office in the "portrait" orientation making it increasingly difficult to view these two figures both electronically and in print. The electronic file image is set to the "portrait" position for all of the pages of U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,666 despite FIGS. 1 and 8 thereof actually being in an original landscape position.

The present invention identifies these pages as the Figure Pages since none of the other pages have this type of header information in them. In addition, the header of each of the Figure Pages of the '666 patent also include "u.s. Patent" text on the left side, followed by "Apr. 8, 2003" and with "u.s. Pat. No. 6,545,666" which may be utilized to identify the figure sheets since this information is not contained within the headers of the text pages of the patent document. 




Head {VI} is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born English figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his "1949 Head" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery.[1] This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void.
Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of "screaming popes",[2] a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works.[3] Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece, Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych.
